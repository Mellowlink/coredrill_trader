A lite-style trading assistant to replace the bloated Binance Desktop app for my own personal use.
No charting included, use alongside Tradingview.

This is some of the dirtiest code I've ever written lol

Keep in mind I just wanted to brute force udnerstanding layouts in Kivy, and also I didn't care about performance or efficiency of code so much because the actual functionality is so simple a bunch of nested if statements don't hurt the app's performance and I just needed a basic GUI with safety features to help my grid trading approach at the time.

But this code is objectively awful if I'm being totally honest.
